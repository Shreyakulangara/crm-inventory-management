# crm-inventory-management

This project is a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Inventory Management System developed using Django and Django REST Framework. It provides a streamlined solution for businesses to manage customer data, inventory, and order processing within a secure and scalable API-driven backend.

The CRM component facilitates storing and managing customer information, tracking interactions, and maintaining contact records, enhancing client relationship management. The inventory module tracks products, their stock levels, prices, and reorder points, ensuring efficient inventory oversight. Integrated with the CRM, the order management module allows users to create and manage customer orders, including itemized order entries, order statuses, and automated total cost calculations.
